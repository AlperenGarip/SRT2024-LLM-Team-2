This is the repository for LLM Team-2 from the 2024 Summer Research Internship Program. In this repository, one can find our work, including code, presentations, and documentation.

## Program Overview 

During this program, under the guidance of our mentors, we will work on topics related to Large Language Models, such as:

- Engage in advanced research focusing on the interactions between multiple AI agents.
- Utilize cutting-edge frameworks like LangChain and Langgraph to develop models that simulate and predict complex behaviors in varied environments.
- Explore the integration of these models into broader AI systems to enhance decision-making processes.
